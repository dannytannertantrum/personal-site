              <strong>Description:</strong> EasyKnock is a modern-day alternative to home equity
              loans. In July 2022, I took over managing a team halfway through a site overhaul while
              the head of technology was out on paternity leave. Talk about being thrown into the
              deep end! This was an incredible opportunity for me to lead by example, lead with
              empathy, and let my coding skills shine. I quickly ramped up on our tech stack
              (Next.js, Prismic, Styled Components) to steer us to a successful deployment of a
              spiffy new website, enhanced security, worked closely with our Product team to define
              roadmaps and with Marketing to provide analytics support (Segment, Google Optimize,
              HubSpot), and managed and mentored an amazing group of engineers.

              easy. At Pluralsight, I started out leading frontend initiatives with React on our

              communicated with a Postgres database and RabbitMQ's messaging services. On the
              Content Assessment Tools team, I relished the opportunity working closely with our
              customers, building solutions to their delight. I also worked on the Search team where
              I learned more about a11y standards and broadened my skill set with TypeScript.

              each game, add new games to the arcade as we play them, and talk trash to each other
              (a v2 feature). Keep it honest...or you're outta the family!

              <strong>Description:</strong> I was happy enough using the ColorNote app on my phone
              for keeping a grocery list, but I wanted to give it my own flavor. I frequent Wegmans
              and Costco the most, so this allows me to filter by store (or alphabetically), and
              gives me that nerdy, terminal-style dark/bright-green theme with some hot magenta
              thrown in. If you enjoy it, by all means use it! Just remember, it uses local storage.
              If you clear history on your device, make sure <em>groceries.jaimefarnan.com</em> is
              on your list of sites to exempt from being cleared.

              <strong>Well, hello there!</strong> Do you like Valentine's Day and coasters? Because
              the graphic in this section is the 2022 installment of custom valentines I create and
              mail out each year to family, friends and coworkers. What started as a crude,
              college-humor joke turned into a tradition I look forward to every February.
            </p>
            <h2><strong>So what else about me?</strong></h2>
            <p>
              I love what I do. I'm passionate about software engineering, belonging, and enjoy the
              process of bringing ideas to life! I probably enjoy it because it's a form of
              creation; I LOVE creating. Outside of being a nerd...well...I'm still a nerd, but
              outside of the software world, I love
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdrRuEfdr6g" target="_blank"
                >creating music</a
              >, poetry and comedy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, doing life with people and relationships are <strong>EVERYTHING</strong> to
              me. My friends and I partner with a family in the Dominican Republic. We set up a
              giving fund through a 501 (c)(3) in order to provide monthly financial support for
              them to serve Santa Lucia, a community that sprung up on the city garbage dump. Aptly
              nicknamed, <em>La Mosca</em> ("fly" in Spanish), we've been making annual trips there
              for over a decade to love and serve alongside our friends. Really though, they're
              family.
